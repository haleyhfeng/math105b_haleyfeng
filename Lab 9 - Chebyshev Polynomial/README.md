# Project 9: Chebyshev Polynomial

Description: The goal of this project is to use Matlab to code and test the accuracy of Chebyshev polynomial approximations. Given a function f(x) and an interval [-1,1], Iâ€™ll be writing a function cheby_coeff that would compute the Chebycheff coefficients and its respecting polynomial approximation of f(x) to find the maximum error between the exact and the approximation.

## Compile/Run the code

The codes are written on Matlab. One can review it by opening "main.m" and run the functions "cheby_coeff.m" in the same folder.

## Contributors
This project is written by Haley Feng with the algorithm provided from textbook: Numerical Analysis, 10th Edition by Richard L. Burden, J. Douglas Faires, & Annette Burden.
