# Project 7: Adaptive Simpson’s Rule

Description: The goal of this project is to use Matlab to test the accuracy of the adaptive Simpson’s rule for computing definite integrals numerically. Using the example integral ∫cos(2x)e−x dx from 0 to 2pi, this lab is going to approximate this integral using adaptive and composite Simpson’s rule and compare
which method uses the least quadrature points to achieve the desired accuracy of 0.5*10-4.

## Compile/Run the code

The codes are written on Matlab. One can review it by opening "main.m".
