# Project 4: Cubic Spline Interpolation

Description: The goal of this project is to write a function in Matlab to compute the coefficient for a cubic spline interpolating function and to use the coefficients to compute and graph a cubic spline interpolating polynomial. Furthermore, I will compute and graph the Lagrange interpolating polynomial as comparison to the natural splines by using the function f(x)=x/((1/4)+x^2).

## Compile/Run the code

The codes are written on Matlab. One can review it by opening "main.m" and run the function "natural_splines.m" and "f_lagrange.m" in the same folder.
