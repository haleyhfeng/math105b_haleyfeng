# Project 6: Trapezoid and Simpson's Rule

Description: The goal of this project is to use Matlab to test the accuracy of the trapezoid and Simpsonâ€™s rules, as well as their composite formulas, for computing definite integrals numerically. Using the example integral of f(x)=xln(x) from 1 to 2, this lab is going to compare the results by examining the error and plotting the curve produce by each formulas to see which method would product the most accurate approximation. 

## Compile/Run the code

The codes are written on Matlab. One can review it by opening "main.m".
