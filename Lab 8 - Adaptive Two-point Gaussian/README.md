# Project 8: Adaptive Two-point Gaussian

Description: The goal of this project is to use Matlab to code and test an adaptive two-point Gaussian integration algorithm. Beginning with an example integral of f(x) = sin(10/x)/x from 1 to 3, this lab is going to approximate using a basic two-point procedure and further build up a recursive method that continuously divide the interval in half and adding the subintervals together to get a closer approximation. 

## Compile/Run the code

The codes are written on Matlab. One can review it by opening "main.m" and run the functions "Adaptive.m" and "Gauss.m" in the same folder.

## Contributors
This project is written by Haley Feng with the algorithm provided from textbook: Numerical Analysis, 10th Edition by Richard L. Burden, J. Douglas Faires, & Annette Burden.
