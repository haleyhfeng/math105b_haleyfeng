# Project 5: Forward, Backward, and Central Difference

Description: The goal of this project is to use Matlab to test the accuracy of forward difference, backward difference, and central difference approximation formulas for computing derivatives of functions numerically. Using the equally-spaced grid points, xi=-5+ih, where h = 10/n and i = 0,..,n, Iâ€™ll be computing and plotting numerous results to compare the difference in using different n values and see how the approximation gets better or worse. 

## Compile/Run the code

The codes are written on Matlab. One can review it by opening "main.m".
