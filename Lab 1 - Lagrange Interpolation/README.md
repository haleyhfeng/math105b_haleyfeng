# Project 1: Lagrange Interpolation Polynomial 

Description: The goal of this project is to write a function in Matlab for interpolation using Lagrange polynomials. By examining the absolute difference between the actual points and the interpolated values computed by Lagrange and plotting the actual function in comparison to the interpolated values, I will achieve a better understand at how using difference values for the Lagrange interpolants provide a trend in receiving a closer estimate to the true values and a more identical approximated plot to the exact function.

## Compile/Run the code

The codes are written on Matlab. One can review it by opening "main.m" and run the function "f_lagrange.m" in the same folder. 

## Contributors
This project is written by Haley Feng with the algorithm provided from textbook: Numerical Analysis, 10th Edition by Richard L. Burden, J. Douglas Faires, & Annette Burden.
