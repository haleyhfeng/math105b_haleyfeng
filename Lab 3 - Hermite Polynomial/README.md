# Project 3: Hermite Polynomial

Description: The goal of this project is to write a function in Matlab to compute the coefficients for a Hermite polynomial interpolating function using divided differences and then to use the coefficients to compute the Hermite interpolating polynomial. Furthermore, I will implement the Hermite polynomial through an example of interpolating the function f(x) =e^(0.1^2) at a point x and at different degree. 

## Compile/Run the code

The codes are written on Matlab. One can review it by opening "main.m" and run the function "hermite.m" in the same folder.
